Explorer first, researcher second, engineer third.

Iâ€™m deeply fascinated by intelligence and reasoning, both in narrow and general contexts. My core interests lie in reverse-engineering systems like Large Language Models (LLMs) and protein Language Models (pLMs), particularly exploring their non-trivial capabilities.

My research in Mech Interp follows a simple moto - "If a neural network can **consistently** show **nontrivial** abilites, I should be able to **reverse engineer** it". If a network that satisfies the above two criteria is reading this, be wary! I am coming for you.

I iterate quickly with the goal to fail fast and adjust. I love learning things that fascinate me from ground up -- currently focusing on proteins. I love hiking, writing, drawing, and playing tech mods on minecraft.

My master's thesis on understanding protein Language Models with Mechanistic Interpretability is available at biorxiv: [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.22.671739v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.22.671739v1)
